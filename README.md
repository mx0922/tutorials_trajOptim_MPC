## Overview
A simple and light-weight tutorial for trajectory optimization (TO) and model predictive control (MPC).

Different from the reinforcement learning (RL), TO and MPC are general model-based control methods, especially for legged robots and manipulators. 

Independent of any external solver, this repository provides a simple and light-weight Matlab (e.g. 2019b version) tutorial for TO and MPC:
1) The TO part is based on the TO software [__trajOptim__](https://github.com/MatthewPeterKelly/OptimTraj) developed by M. Kelly, who currently works for Atlas in Boston Dynamics.
2) The MPC part is referred to the [linear MPC controlller](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4115592) for bipedal robots proposed by P. B. Wieber.
3) The robot visulization software is organized by Xiang Meng, which are derived from [_Introduction to Humanoid Robotics_](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-54536-8) written by S. Kajita _et_ _al_.
